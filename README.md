# E-commerce-transaction-dataset
This project applies data science techniques to analyze customer behavior, build predictive models, and provide actionable insights. It includes three tasks: **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns, a **Lookalike Model** to find similar customers, and **Customer Segmentation** using clustering for personalized marketing.

# Customer Segmentation, Lookalike Model, and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project leverages data science techniques to analyze customer behavior, build predictive models, and provide actionable insights. The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing customer and transaction data to uncover patterns and trends.
2. **Lookalike Model**: Recommending customers similar to a target customer based on profile and transaction data.
3. **Customer Segmentation / Clustering**: Grouping customers into distinct segments based on their profiles and transaction behaviors.
